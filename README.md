Recipe app. It allows you to add a new recipe to the database, 
save it to favorites, create shopping lists 
and search for recipes by categories or ingredients you have in the fridge!

## General info
Writing this application allows me to explore and learn Spring, so the program is not ready yet.
My goal is to finish it and use it in my own kitchen.
So far I've learned, among other things, how to write integration tests,
how to use basic annotations in Spring, how to create a basic page view in HTML and CSS.

## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Java
* JUnit5
* Spring
* HTML, CSS
* Mockito, MockMvc
